## Installation

1. Copy all of the files in the **`1. Stock`** folder into your Diablo II folder,
   replacing the files that are already there. **`(Installs Vanilla D2)`**

2. Copy all of the files in the **`2. Files`** folder into your
   Diablo II folder, replacing the files that are already there. **`(Installs Succulent)`**

3. Launch the game with **`Game.exe`**.

If you want to have multiple copies of Diablo II all installed in one folder, with full mod and character isolation, use my [Diablo II Version Switcher, Cactus](https://github.com/fearedbliss/Cactus).

## Tips

### GlideWrapper

You should setup GlideWrapper (**`glide-init.exe`**) if you haven't, this will allow
your game to look much better and run smoother in both Window and
Full Screen modes. After you setup Glide, add **`-3dfx`** to the end
of your executable path.
